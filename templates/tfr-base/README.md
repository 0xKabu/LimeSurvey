BASIC_END

Congratulations! You have acquired the Premium TFR version of our Bootstrap based LimeSurvey template. You are entitled to new releases of this template for 1 year after purchase! This is version 2.5.0.

***************************************************

Please be aware that this template will work only on LimeSurvey 2.5 installations and not on LimeSurvey 2.06 and earlier!

Release: v2.5.0+201696155236 build on 201696155236
#Release 2.5.0 (last release before LimeSurvey 2.5)
* fully compatible with LimeSurvey 2.5
* with an eye for detail

* responsive tables in two flavours: Bootstraps swipe solution and TFRs exploded view


# Introduction
We have tested the template and it works on version 2.5 of Limesurvey.

The template will work fine on all modern major browsers: Internet Explorer version 9 and up, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari. IE8 is not modern, so it will probably fail in that browser. 

# License
You are free to alter this template and to use it on any server you want. 

This template is licenced under GPL 2.0. This means you can do with it whatever you want. But: please contact us on all found errors and possible improvements. We like to keep up to date!

When you like this template please spread the word. Small donations are more than welcome as well.

# Premium features
* All tables are fully responsive and thus a joy to view and work with on small devices
* Slider questions (multiple numerical, slider layout) indicate whether they have been moved or not
* The Premium TFR version has a bit more color than our Free version, but not too much. We think that adds to the feeling of comfort of the respondent
* The Free version will only be available in 1 color: gray with signal colors

# On using images (all versions of the template)
Because we want your survey to look crisp and clear on all devices, we have implemented retina.js (from http://imulus.github.io/retinajs/). Using retina.js is optional; you can add images at will, but when you add the same images in retina quality, the script replaces the default image with the retinaimages (imagename@2x.png for example), displaying a higher resolution image on specific devices, like Apple Retina iPads.

# New releases
Since we hope to distribute improved versions periodically, we hope that you send us your improvements, so we can incorporate them in newer version. We cannot guarantee that we will incorporate all suggestions, but we will certainly look at them. Please visit our website for news on the template and to download the newest version and to send us your bug reports and suggestions for improvement.

# Credits
This template was defined by [Tools for Research] (url http://www.toolsforresearch.com) and designed by [Peter Emil](url https://nl.linkedin.com/in/peteremil) van den Berg of [pixelliquid](url http://pixelliquid.com). We had great help from Clemens Tolboom who has ironed out a workflow using Grunt which makes it easier for us to have different versions of the template.

# Inspiration
When we started working on our first template (v1.7x) we looked around if anyone had already done work on this. We found the work by mofog at: https://github.com/mofog/BootstrapForLimeSurvey This inspired us, thank you, mofog!
